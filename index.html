		<h1> Empty Campus</h1>
		<p>
		With more than 48,000 students spanning two campuses in the heart of Los Angeles, USC boasts an energized, hardworking student body, which moves in a constant frenzy from class to work every day. 
		</p>
		<p>
		This usual campus rhythm has since transformed to a humdrum due to the coronavirus pandemic. Save for the dozens of essential workers and more than 1,000 students still on campus, typical hotspots, leisure areas and study spaces are left barren. From the bustling Trousdale Parkway to the tucked-away Scene Dock Theatre, nearly all activity across the University has been erased. With the status of in-person classes for the fall semester uncertain, here is a glimpse into what our campus has looked like while we’ve been away.

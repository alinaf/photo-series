		<h1>Campus Gone Quiet</h1>
		<p>
		With more than 48,000 students spanning two campuses in the heart of Los Angeles, USC comprises an energized, hardworking student body, which moves in a constant frenzy from class to work every day. 
		</p>
		<p>
		This usual campus rhythm has since transformed to a humdrum due to the coronavirus pandemic. Save for the dozens of essential workers and nearly 1,400 students still on campus, typical hotspots, leisure areas and study spaces are left barren. From the bustling Trousdale Parkway to the tucked-away Scene Dock Theatre, nearly all activity across the University has been erased. With the status of in-person classes for the fall semester uncertain, here is a glimpse into what the campus has looked like while the bulk of its community has been away.

		<h3>Hahn Plaza</h3>
		<p>One of the busiest parts of campus on a normal day, Hahn Plaza has gotten next to no visitors recently as in-person tours have been canceled and postponed and campus access has been limited.</p>

		<h3>McCarthy Quad</h3>
		<p>Commonly passed through by students on their way to class and the location of numerous concerts and festivals at USC, McCarthy Quad now serves neither purpose. </p>
	</div>

		<h3>Childs Way</h3>
		<p>Childs Way’s narrow pathway typically causes a traffic jam for students walking, biking and boarding to class. Now, stomping feet and whirling wheels are nowhere in sight.</p>
	</div>

		<h3>Village square</h3>
		<p>The picnic tables at USC Village, normally a popular lunch spot and gathering place for students, now sit alone, vacant.</p>

		<h3>Starbucks at USC Village</h3>
		<p>Usually bustling with caffeine-craving students, Starbucks at USC Village is desolate, the hum of the machines gone quiet.</p>

		<h3>West 34th Street</h3>
		<p>En route to USC Village, West 34th Street was a hub for USC buses headed toward the Health Sciences Campus, USC City Center and Union Station.</p>

		<h3>VKC</h3>
		<p>The only movement outside these once busy classrooms is the waving of the flags blown by the wind.</p>
	</div>

		<h3>Fertitta Hall</h3>
		<p>The sun shines on the empty courtyard in front of the building, the doors of which remain untouched.</p>

		<img src="img/IMG_4512.jpg">
		<h3>Watt Way</h3>
		<p>Once teeming with students, tourists and Lyfts, a street inside campus that lines a few of the engineering and science buildings is now absent of cars and pedestrians.</p>

		<h3>Engineering Quad</h3>
